# 2019-viral-and-cancer-shared-mechanisms

This project was conducted during summer of 2019 and unfortunately I did not have the hindsight in highschool to save the code on my old laptop so this is all that is left of the project. 

The project was piggybacked off of the hypothesis that cancer and viruses have developed in comparable ways over time and has potentially led to the evolution of shared defense mechanisms between cancer’s defense against drugs and our cell’s defense against viruses. Our goal was to find shared interactions, proteins, and pathways between drug resistant cancer cells and viruses.

Over the summer, I learned and used beginner R to parse, engineer, and visualize data provided by the lab. I also used Cytoscape to create most of the protein interaction networks seen on the slides. A partner and I were able to translate code used for network propagation from MatLab to R to be used for my project.
